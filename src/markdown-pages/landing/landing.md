  heading: Make your user experience the best it can be.
  text: Frustrating online experiences reflect poorly on government, undermining the public’s faith in the capability of their elected officials and public servants to deliver services. In the digital-era, constituents expect governments to offer the same calibre of digital service seen in online banking, or travel. In response, governments are increasingly using various types of user research approaches, including user feedback data, to make services more accountable and transparent, while ensuring that online services resonate with constituents’ heightened expectations of 21st government service provision.
